## Update
Update from version 0.7.5 to 0.7.8. This update was initially motivated by an incompatibility issue introduced in a recent update of the dependency package "bnlearn". This incompatibility has been fixed and no further errors are present.
Appart from this, in this update I added generic methods for my S3 objects "dbn" and "dbn.fit". I also extended the generic methods for bnlearn's S3 objects "bn" and "bn.fit" to work with "dbn" and "dbn.fit" objects. All available generic methods are now shown with methods(class="dbn") and methods(class="dbn.fit"). The documentation has been improved for exported functions and hidden for internal functions when calling help(package="dbnR"). Additionally, regular prints for low-level functions have been exchanged with cats and inverse matrix calculation is now performed with MASS::ginv(). This version maintains backwards compatibility with older versions.

## Test environments
* Windows 10 (x64), R 4.1.3 (local)
* Ubuntu 18.04 (x64), R 4.1.2 (local)
* Rhub
* win-builder (devel, release and oldrelease)

## R CMD check results
0 ERRORs | 0 WARNINGs | 3 NOTEs

* Those are the names of the authors of some of the papers I cite in the description, they are not mis-spelled words.

checking installed package size ... NOTE
  installed size is  5.3Mb
  sub-directories of 1Mb or more:
    libs   4.5Mb
    
* My package uses C++ code with Rcpp, and in linux systems this seems to cause the 'libs' folder to get bloated.

  It is good practice to register native routines and to disable symbol
  search.
  
  See 'Writing portable packages' in the 'Writing R Extensions' manual.

* I only get this note on my local win10 machine with R versions >4.1.1. I have not changed anything related to the C++ code and I did not get this note before. After looking for solutions to this, it seems like it has to do with some kind of interaction between devtools and Rstudio on Windows machines.
